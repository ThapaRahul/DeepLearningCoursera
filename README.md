# DeepLearningCoursera


This repo containts all/most of the files from different courses in deep learning specialization in Coursera taught by a renowned figure in deep learning, Professor Andrew Ng. Please, do check the full course https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?. It is very informative. Professor Ng begins from basic concepts and goes on to expalin convolutional neural network and other computer vision algorithms. Also, he uses tensorflow framework for the assignments, which is the most popular machine learning framework right now.
